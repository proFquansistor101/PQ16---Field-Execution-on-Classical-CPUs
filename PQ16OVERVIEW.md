# PQ16 — Overview

**Series:** Quansistor Field Computing — Compendium  
**Branch:** PQ — Execution, Governance, and Deployment Semantics  

## Scope
This document is part of the PQ branch of the QFC Compendium and focuses on
Field Execution on Classical CPUs.

It contributes to the executional and governance layer of Quansistor Field
Computing by formalizing how field-native computation is executed, governed,
and verified on real infrastructure.

## Role within PQ
Within the PQ sequence, this document advances the progression from abstract
execution regimes toward deployable, auditable, and institutionally usable
field-native systems.

## Status
Conceptual / theoretical research document.
